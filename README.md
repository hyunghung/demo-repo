**Module 1 Challenge**

Within this challenge, we are asked to use the starter code and write the codes to make the code look visually simpler but also ensure
that the code follows different requirements. These requirements consist of accessibility standards, semantic HTML elements, accessible 
alt attributes, heading attributes, sequential order, and title elements.

Attached above is the only accessibility I could apply to the website since most users tend to struggle to find out more information
regarding a topic. 

Other than that, I was not too sure how to get the link for the deployed application so I was not able to do that part.
